# Blood And Iron Crash Exploit
This is an obfuscated file to protect the raw script from being patched by Blood and Iron staff themselves.

## Getting script

And big thanks to MoonSec for letting me obfuscated this script.


## Instruction
+ Client crasher need to be spamed (round start) for work.
+ Server crasher dont need to do anything 
+ Change method to server 


```lua
  getgenv().Target_To_Crash = "server" 
```
As seen above this is Target to Crash if you want to change to client crasher simply do this
```lua
  getgenv().Target_To_Crash = "client" 
```


## Exploit
Work for all exploit even free exploit(I haven't tested on jjsploit). But you may need to add this line if dont want lag spike causing by "localclean" script. This is called the Rifthook bypass :
```lua
  task.spawn(function()
	local LocalPlayer = game.Players.LocalPlayer
	local oldNameCall
	oldNameCall = hookmetamethod(game,"__namecall",function(self,...)
		local args = {...}
		local method = getnamecallmethod()
		if not checkcaller() and getcallingscript().Name == "LocalClean" then -- localclean is retarded tbh
			return {}
		end
		if method == "FireServer" and self.Name == "RequestPlayerKick" then
			return "fortnite sussy balls :pensive:"
		end
		return oldNameCall(self,...)
	end)
	while game:GetService("RunService").RenderStepped:Wait() do
		if LocalPlayer.Character and LocalPlayer.Character:FindFirstChild("CharacterControl") then
			LocalPlayer.Character:FindFirstChild("CharacterControl").Disabled = true
		end
	end
end)
```
Add this at the first line of the script. Because I have added this at the beginning of the script it no longer require you to do so. But only use it if causing so many lag when injecting a script that not support Rifthook bypass
